9.Now in tibia you press "Options" then "Network Settings" and then UNcheck(remove) "Test Server Login"
10.Now its only to login on Tibia.


Connect to a server whit IP List:

2.Press "IP List".
3.The list to the left is a list of all your added servers.
4.Press one of the servers in the server list and ip,server name And port are gonig to be written to the right.
5.Press Connect IP if you want to change the ip. (Make shure that tibia is on).


Add a server to the IP List:

What is:

Tray Icon:

To the right of the Computer Clock you can see some small "Icons".
Normaly MSN and Norton Antivirus is there.
I have added so you can add my ip changer there so its more easy to reach then before.

The Shortcut function:

At tibia versions below 7.6 you could add "host IP port 7171" in the shortcut of your tibia.
But now has CIPSoft removed that function.
But now you can do the same thing whit my program.
If you Make a Shortcut on the ip changer and right click and select properties.
Now after the "C:\xxx\xxx\Tibia MULTI-ip changer.exe" you add something whit this:

port (port number)
host (IP you want to connect)
version (version of the server, good to have if you using many diffrent) ex: version 7.6
close (Closes the ip changer when the ip is changed)

Exempel:
If you want to connect the ip "tibia.no-ip.com", and use the port 7174, and use the version 7.5 and then Close
the program you write this after the shortcut:
host tibia.no-ip.com port 7174 version 7.5 close

so the shortcut is "C:\xxx\xxx\Tibia MULTI-ip changer.exe" host tibia.no-ip.com port 7174 version 7.5 close

Remeber:
You have to start the tibia client before using the link.
